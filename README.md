# QuaternionLib
Quaternion geometric library in Python

**Entirely written using chatGPT4.**

_I wonder what this does to the licence?_

Contains 3 classes:
- Quaternion,
- Line (2 quaternions, one for an origin and one for a direction) and 
- Plane (2 quaternions: one for an origin and one for a normal)

And it comes with unit tests. Trying to figure out how to have chatGPT add coverage test.
