# QuaternionLib
Quaternion geometric library in Python

**Entirely written using chatGPT4.**

_I wonder what this does to the licence?_

Contains 3 classes:
- Quaternion,
- Line (2 quaternions, one for an origin and one for a direction) and
- Plane (2 quaternions: one for an origin and one for a normal)

chatGPT was graceful enough to write unit tests.
Trying to figure out how to have chatGPT add coverage test.

This led me to learn about [Rotors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_(mathematics).)
